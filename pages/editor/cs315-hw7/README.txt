The main problem was figuring out my robot design. Since I've never really
drawn an original creation with graphics this way, it was a bit of a challenge to
come up with a design that I could actually create. So I played around with some basic
shapes for a bit and slowly came up with a design I actually liked.

Being someone lacking in (visual) artistic skills, it was a bit hard, so I relied mainly on
symmetry to get the shapes of the torso and claw right. But when it finally came together,
especially after properly orienting the claws and adding smaller details such as
the feet and the wrist (all of which are tori), it started to look a lot
more like something out of a science fiction movie/game, which is sort of what I hoped
for from the start.

Also, there's a weird distortion that occasionally appears across part of the frame in both Chrome and Firefox.

I used quadraticCurveTo() to make the outward-facing outline of each claw.
Note that the torso was made with ExtrudeGeometry and is beveled slightly.
